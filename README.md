# EmployeeAdminPanel
Creating an admin panel using Angular involves building a web application that provides a user interface for administrators to manage and control various aspects of a system or application.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.6.


# Steps to Create an Admin Panel with Angular:
1. Angular Setup:
Set up your Angular environment by installing Angular CLI and creating a new Angular project.

npm install -g @angular/cli
ng new admin-panel

# Designing Layouts and Components:
Define the layout and structure of your admin panel. Create components for different sections like dashboard, user management, settings, analytics, etc.

# Routing Configuration:
Use Angular Router to set up routing for various sections/pages within the admin panel.
For Example
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'dashboard', component: DashboardComponent },
  { path: 'users', component: UsersComponent },
  // Add more routes for different sections
  { path: '', redirectTo: '/dashboard', pathMatch: 'full' },
];

## Development server

Prepare your application for deployment. Build the Angular app and deploy it to a hosting service or server.
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

# Responsive UI/UX Development:
Use Angular Material or other UI frameworks to create a responsive and user-friendly interface for the admin panel. Design forms, tables, charts, and other components.

# Integration with Backend:
Connect your admin panel to a backend server or API to fetch and update data. Ensure proper handling of API responses and errors.

# Testing and Debugging:
Test your admin panel thoroughly to ensure functionality across different browsers and devices. Use Angular's built-in testing tools or frameworks

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

# Continuous Improvement:
I have created various components for the admin panel, including profile, attendance sheet, login/logout pages, task updates, leave management, holidays, and designed a responsive UI/UX layout.
